Password Evaluation

Password Example	Score	Strength Level	Feedback	Screenshot

fatima123	20%	Weak	Too short, predictable, lacks symbols & uppercase letters	
Fatima@2024	65%	Medium	Good use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbol, but could be longer	
F@t!ma_2024_Secure	90%	Strong	Long, includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and multiple symbols	
P@ssw0rd!23456789	95%	Very Strong	Excellent complexity and length

Key Learnings

Passwords should be longer than 12â€“14 characters.

Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid common patterns (e.g., 1234, qwerty, password).

Passphrases (random words joined together) are both strong and memorable.

Reuse of passwords across accounts increases risk.

Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination until it succeeds.

Dictionary Attack: Uses common words or leaked password lists.

Credential Stuffing: Uses stolen username-password pairs from data breaches.



---

Best Practices

Use unique passwords for every account.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

Consider using a password manager (Bitwarden, LastPass, KeePass) to securely store passwords.

Create passphrases instead of short complex strings (e.g., Sun!Tree$River2025).
